# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the Moonwall testing framework codebase from traditional Promise-based TypeScript to Effect-TS. The migration aims to improve error handling, resource management, composability, and maintainability while ensuring zero breaking changes for end users and maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Moonwall, I want the migration to Effect-TS to be completely transparent so that my existing test suites continue to work without any modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing public APIs SHALL maintain their current signatures and behavior
2. WHEN existing test suites are run THEN they SHALL pass without any modifications
3. WHEN users import Moonwall functions THEN they SHALL receive the same TypeScript types as before
4. IF a user calls any public API THEN the function SHALL return the same Promise-based interface as before

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Moonwall maintainer, I want to gradually adopt Effect-TS starting from utility functions so that I can minimize risk and validate the approach incrementally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the migration THEN utility functions in the `@moonwall/util` package SHALL be migrated first
2. WHEN migrating utility functions THEN they SHALL be converted to Effect internally while maintaining Promise-based public APIs
3. WHEN a utility function is migrated THEN it SHALL have comprehensive tests validating both Effect and Promise behaviors
4. IF any utility function migration fails THEN it SHALL be easily rollback-able without affecting other functions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Moonwall maintainer, I want robust error handling throughout the codebase so that errors are properly typed, traceable, and recoverable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any migrated function THEN it SHALL be represented as a typed Effect error
2. WHEN errors are propagated THEN they SHALL maintain full stack traces and context information
3. WHEN functions can fail in multiple ways THEN each failure mode SHALL be represented as a distinct error type
4. IF an error occurs during resource cleanup THEN it SHALL not prevent other cleanup operations from executing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Moonwall maintainer, I want proper resource management for all external connections so that resources are automatically cleaned up even when errors occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing connections to blockchain nodes THEN they SHALL be managed as Effect resources with automatic cleanup
2. WHEN Docker containers are started THEN they SHALL be managed as Effect resources with guaranteed cleanup
3. WHEN file handles or network sockets are opened THEN they SHALL be automatically closed when no longer needed
4. IF an error occurs during operation THEN all acquired resources SHALL still be properly cleaned up

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Moonwall maintainer, I want improved composability of async operations so that complex workflows can be built from smaller, reusable components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN combining multiple async operations THEN they SHALL be composable using Effect combinators
2. WHEN operations need to run in parallel THEN they SHALL use Effect's structured concurrency
3. WHEN operations need to be retried THEN they SHALL use Effect's built-in retry mechanisms
4. IF operations need timeouts THEN they SHALL use Effect's timeout capabilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Moonwall maintainer, I want comprehensive testing of the migration so that I can be confident in the reliability of the new implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any function is migrated THEN it SHALL have tests covering both success and failure scenarios
2. WHEN resource management is implemented THEN it SHALL have tests verifying proper cleanup in all scenarios
3. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL have tests verifying all error paths and error types
4. IF performance is critical THEN migrated functions SHALL have performance tests comparing before and after

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Moonwall maintainer, I want clear migration guidelines and patterns so that the team can consistently apply Effect-TS throughout the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating any function THEN there SHALL be documented patterns for common scenarios
2. WHEN creating new Effect-based functions THEN there SHALL be clear naming conventions and structure guidelines
3. WHEN handling errors THEN there SHALL be consistent error type definitions and handling patterns
4. IF new team members join THEN they SHALL have clear documentation on Effect-TS usage within Moonwall

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Moonwall maintainer, I want the migration to be performed in phases so that each phase can be thoroughly tested and validated before proceeding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning the migration THEN it SHALL be divided into distinct phases with clear boundaries
2. WHEN completing each phase THEN all tests SHALL pass and functionality SHALL be verified
3. WHEN moving between phases THEN there SHALL be clear rollback procedures if issues are discovered
4. IF any phase encounters significant issues THEN it SHALL be possible to pause and reassess without affecting completed phases
